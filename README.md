# Linux Controller Control
---
On Windows, there are many a program for controlling the computer with a controller, such as Joy2Key. However, linux has no such tool. As a result, in a dark room somewhere in Texas, a developer decided to create such a tool on linux - and since he had no idea how to name things, he chose to name it Linux Controller Control (Or LCC for short)!
### Installation
To compile the project, go into the folder you wish to install the program into and run the command `cmake **PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_FOLDER**`, followed by `make`. There should at that point be a file named Linux-Controller-Control in the folder - This is the program. You can run it from the terminal by using `./Linux-Controller-Control`, or by opening the file from a file explorer.
